**progress**

I'm currently testing this example to learn image recognition and when I'm done I'll be using data from kaggle.com to see if it works for a common plant disease named Anthracnose
https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/

The model I'm testing is on google colab and it's still training so I don't know what will happen if I put it to github right away so here's the link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J42DCXtgQJ-TEXU7urDiCCIYSCzd4bwE#scrollTo=ub8sfhKWIWjO
it's basically the same thing as the example but me trying to do it

this person might help you understand better if you're new to keras: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0FOA1DAohI&list=PLvk-72jrjBFFsb0dKG0l2SEwK95p4vM89&index=7

I'm still figuring out how to do the same thing for multiple diseases but if I do, I'll update it over here

It's probably going to be adjusting the code a little bit and more of gathering a lot of images for the model to train from now on, so if you want to help(maybe) you can help me get more images for the model!

the ai can't detect all the diseases but I'll be training it on the most common ones.

potential list for indoor plants is(will update if I'm done with these):
Gray Mold/Botrytis
Powdery Mildew
Leaf Spot
Root Rot
Viruses(after other ones are done because this one might take longer)

this is where I got it from:
